# Planned Features

## Download External Images

We are planning the ability to save external images locally when they are specified.

## Convert to specified format

We plan to have the ability to convert to a specified format.

For example, to convert to webp, the following configuration is used.

```js title="export-images.config.js"
module.exports = {
  convertFormat: 'webp',
}
```

This API is in the planning stage and is subject to change in practice.
